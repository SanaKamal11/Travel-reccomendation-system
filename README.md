# Travel Recommendation System

A Python-based project that recommends travel destinations based on user interests like activities or preferences.

This project filters travel destinations from a dataset based on keywords (like "beach", "hiking", etc.) and returns top-rated matches.

- `requirements.txt` – Python packages needed  
- `README.md` – project description

## How to Run
